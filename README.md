# PeakIQ
    
    PeakIQ is an AI-powered optimization tool designed to keep APIs running at peak performance. Built with an LLM-powered recommendation engine and deployed on the Akash Network, PeakIQ analyzes real-time metrics to detect bottlenecks and provide actionable insights for API improvements. These insights include recommendations for caching, load balancing, and database tuning.

## Project Overview

PeakIQ aims to help developers and DevOps teams optimize their API performance through intelligent, data-driven recommendations. The tool collects real-time performance metrics, analyzes them, and suggests improvements to reduce latency and optimize resource utilization.

---

## Features

- **Real-Time Metrics Tracking**: Collects response times, request volumes, and error rates.
- **AI-Driven Recommendations**: Suggests optimizations based on metrics, including caching, load balancing, and indexing.
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Visualizes API metrics and recommendations for quick insights.
- **Containerized with Docker**: Easily deployable on the Akash Network.

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Docker**: Ensure Docker is installed and running.
- **Git**: Use Git to clone the repository.

### Clone the Repository

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/PeakIQ.git
cd PeakIQ
```

---

## Docker Setup

### Build and Run the Application

The application consists of several services, including the backend, LLM engine, Redis database, and a frontend dashboard. 

1. **Start Docker Containers**: Run the following command to build and start the containers:

    ```
    docker-compose up --build
    ```

2. **Check Status**: Verify that all containers (`backend`, `llm_engine`, `redis`, and `dashboard`) are running without errors. You should see logs indicating the backend is accessible at `http://localhost:8000`.

3. **Stop Containers**: To stop the containers, use:

    ```
    docker-compose down
    ```

## API Endpoints

### 1. Metrics Endpoint

Use this endpoint to submit API metrics that PeakIQ will analyze.

- **Endpoint**: `/metrics`
- **Method**: `POST`
- **Example Request**:
    ```
    curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/metrics -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"endpoint": "/api test","response_time": 120, "status_code": 200,"timestamp": "2024-11-03T22:10:00"}'
    ```
- **Expected Response**:
    ```
    {"status": "Metrics received"}
    ```

## 2. Recommendations Endpoint
This endpoint provides optimization suggestions based on submitted metrics.

- **Endpoint**: `/recommendations`
- **Method**: `POST`
- **Example Request**:
    ```
    curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/recommendations" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"endpoint": "/api/test"}'
    ```
- **Expected Response**:
    ```
    {"recommendation": "Consider caching this endpoint for optimization."}
    ```

## 3. LM Endpoint
To directly interact with the LLM engine for testing purposes:

- **Endpoint**: `/recommendations`
- **Port**: `8001`
- **Example Request**:
    ```
    curl -X POST "http://localhost:8001/recommendations" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"text": "Optimize API performance"}'
    ```
- **Response**:
    ```
    {"recommendation": "Optimize API performance by..."}
    ```

---

# Usage Guide

1. **Access the Dashboard**: Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:YOUR_DASHBOARD_PORT` to view real-time metrics and recommendations.

2. **Submit Metrics**: Use the `/metrics` endpoint to continuously submit data for any API you’re monitoring.

3. **View Recommendations**: After submitting metrics, use the `/recommendations` endpoint to receive improvement suggestions. These insights are shown on the dashboard as well.

---

# Updates in Latest Version

In the latest merge, implemented the following key features:

1. **Core Backend Features**:
- **Metrics Collection and Storage**: Added endpoints to collect, store, and retrieve API metrics. This includes capturing response times, status codes, and request timestamps for all API interactions.
- **Recommendation Engine**: Integrated the LLM-powered recommendation endpoint to provide optimized suggestions for improving API performance based on usage data.

2. **API Enhancements**:
- **POST** `/api/metrics`: Collects API usage metrics and stores them in a data structure to be accessed by the frontend.
- **GET** `/api/metrics`: Retrieves all stored metrics in real time, allowing for dynamic monitoring of API performance.
- **POST** `/api/recommendations`: Generates performance optimization suggestions for API endpoints using the recommendation engine.
